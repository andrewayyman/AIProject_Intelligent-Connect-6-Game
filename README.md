## Minimax Algorithm Implementation

The project features the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making approach widely used in two-player games. Minimax recursively evaluates game states to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing wins or minimizing losses.

## Alpha-Beta Pruning Integration

To enhance the decision-making process, Alpha-Beta Pruning is integrated with the Minimax algorithm. This optimization reduces the number of evaluated game states, improving efficiency without compromising strategic depth.

## Heuristic Function Design

Heuristic functions are developed to provide a quick evaluation of a given board state. These functions capture patterns and configurations conducive to winning, guiding the AI player's decisions in situations where an exhaustive search is impractical.

## User-Friendly Interface

A user-friendly interface is designed to allow seamless interaction with the intelligent Connect-6 player. Users can input desired board sizes and engage in strategic games against the AI.

## Optimization and Performance

The AI algorithms are optimized for performance, considering computational efficiency and responsiveness. The goal is to create an intelligent player that balances strategic depth with real-time responsiveness during gameplay.

## Conclusion

This project delivers an intelligent Connect-6 player that combines the strategic depth of Minimax, the efficiency of Alpha-Beta Pruning, and the adaptability of heuristic functions. The implementation provides users with a challenging and engaging gaming experience, showcasing the capabilities of AI in strategic decision-making within the context of board games.
